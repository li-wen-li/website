<p>#Before modeling on a dataset, often times we need to ‘clean the data’ first.</p>
<p>And this ‘cleaning’ process is part of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), common steps to be done in this process include checking if there exist any missing value, and how the data is distributed, any outliers or skewness. The definition of outlier is quite vague, so it wouldn’t be appropriate to remove all outliers if the data points sit far away from the mainstream, one has to make sure its not due to data entry error. One primary technique to resolve outliers is to do data transformation.</p>
<div id="when-is-data-skewd" class="section level1">
<h1>When is data skewd?</h1>
<p>When it comes to skewed data, we can perform several transformations, like Log Transform, Square Root Transform or Inverse Transform. But how do we know if the data is skewed? And what kind of transformation should we perform?</p>
<p>Typically you can make a plot about your data, and if there is large number of data points on the left side, then the data is Right(positive) Skewed, if there is large number of data points on the right side then your data is Left(negative) Skewed.</p>
<p><img src="/figures/data_skew.png" alt="Data Skewness" />
You can also check the skewness statistic yourself:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>check_skew &lt;- function(x){
  v = var(x)
  skewness = sum((x - mean(x))^3)/((length(x)-1)*v^(3/2))
  return(skewness)
}</code></pre>
<p>The value should be close to 0 if the data is about symmetric.</p>
<p>Another way to decide if the data is skewed is to find out the ratio between the highest value and lowest value, if the ratio is greater than 20, then the data is significanlt skewed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>skew_ratio &lt;- function(x){
  ratio = max(x)/min(x)
  return(ratio &gt; 20)
}</code></pre>
</div>
