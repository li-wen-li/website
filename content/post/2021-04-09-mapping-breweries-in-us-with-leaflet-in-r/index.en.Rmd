It was a wonderful Friday night when I walked into a local beer shop called "101 Bottles of Beer on the Wall". I did not actually make effort to count how many bottles of beer were actually on the wall. They indeed have A LOT of different kinds of beers. And that made me wonder how many companies are making draft beers in United States. Then I found a data set made available on Kaggle by [__Brett Kurzawa__](http://kaggle.com/brkurzawa/usbreweries), and here is map of all breweries.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  uszipcodes, ## I created this package available on Github
  leaflet,
  stringr,
  dplyr
)
```

>I created the package _uszipcodes_ and it is available in my [_github_](https://github.com/li-wen-li/uszipcodes). It includes zip code location data and some handy functions to clean data.

```{r}
beers <- read.csv("~/R_Projects/my_website/website/content/post/2021-04-09-mapping-breweries-in-us-with-leaflet-in-r/breweries_us.csv") ## data downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/brkurzawa/us-breweries
colnames(beers)
raw_zip <- get_zip(beers$address)
sum(contain_letter(raw_zip))
beers$Zip <- as.integer(clean_zip(raw_zip))
beer_location <- inner_join(beers, zip_table[ , c(1,4,5)])

content <- beer_location %>%
  mutate(popup = paste0('<a href =', beer_location$website, '>', beer_location$brewery_name, '</a>'))
beer_icon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "~/R_Projects/website/website/static/images/beer_glass.png",
  iconWidth = 28, iconHeight = 30,
  iconAnchorX = 0, iconAnchorY = 0
)
beer_map <- leaflet(beer_location) %>%
  setView(lng = -98.583, lat = 39.833, zoom = 4) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Wikimedia) %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = beer_location$Longitude, lat = beer_location$Latitude,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
             popup = content$popup,
             icon = beer_icon
  )
```
