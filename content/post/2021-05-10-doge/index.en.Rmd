Dogecoin has been the topic over internet communities like Twitter and Reddit. It soared more than 20,000 % for the past year. This article has absolutely no analysis in a financial sense. I am simply curious about how and when the madness of dogecoin started.

First, lets take a look at how people across the whole nation is curious about this thing Dogecoin. And here lets use Google Trend.

```{r}
library(gtrendsR)
library(tidyverse)
library(usmap)

dogecoin <- gtrends("dogecoin",geo = "US", time = "today 3-m")
dogecoin_by_state <- dogecoin$interest_by_region
dogecoin_by_state$fips <- cdlTools::fips(dogecoin_by_state$location)
plot_usmap(data = dogecoin_by_state, values = "hits",  color = "#4bb9c9", labels=FALSE) + 
  scale_fill_continuous( low = "white", high = "#4bb9c9", 
                         name = "Popularity", label = scales::comma
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "right") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(colour = "black")) + 
  labs(title = "How people across nation is furious about Dogecoin", subtitle = "Measured by Google Hits", caption = "Source: @Linear Fragility")



top10_doge_state <- head(dogecoin$interest_by_region[order(dogecoin$interest_by_region$hits, decreasing = TRUE), ], n = 10)
print(top10_doge_state$location)
```
