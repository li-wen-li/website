<p>One of my all time favorite movies is Tom Hank’s Cast Away.</p>
<p>In the movie, there was a scene in which Tom Hanks did some math about how big the search area could be for his crashed plane.</p>
<p>His FedEx plane flew from Memphis for 11.5 hours at a constant speed of 475 mile per hour. If this was simply the case, Tom Hank’s role, Chuck Noland, would have been rescued “immediately” and get back to his business schedule, and the movie would have ended. A twist to the story is that his plane flew out of the route for about an hour which was about 400 miles. Search party’s job was to start looking from where they thought Chuck’s plane crashed, and they would take that location as the center of a circle of search.</p>
<p>So, to actually reach the island where Chuck Noland was stranded, 400 miles away from that search circle’s center, the search party would need to search for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> * <span class="math inline">\(400^{2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(miles^{2}\)</span> = 502400 <span class="math inline">\(mile^{2}\)</span></p>
