Today, lets talk about some psychologies associated with decision making under uncertainty.

In a video I made before, {{<youtube sMFy5HNK9Kw>}} 

I used a dice example to demonstrate the mathematical term *Expectation*, we figured the expectation in the dice problem was 3.5. There was a quite important idea in that formula: probabilitties for each outcome was 1/6, which eventually add up tp a sum of 1. Correct, this  is eventually the key idea, all probabilities add up to 1.

Let me first introduce a paper, *Belief-Based Account of Decision Under Uncertainty*, by Craig Fox, a Psychology professor from UCLA, in 1998. He disigned an experiment in which students (46 man, 4 woman) from Northwestern University, who had watched NBA in the regular season, sat down and estimated the probability that each of the eight teams in quarter final round would win the playoff.

Take a moment and try to find out if this figure appears any suspicious to you.

If you did pay attention, you should be able to observe that probabilities for each of the eight teams added up to 2.18, which is 218%.
Probabilitites for each division added up to 1.44, 144% and for conference, they add up to just about 1.

Now, thi s result is absolutely absurd and against what we had learned about the probability fact that probabilities for all possible events should sum up to one.

#### Well, what happened in that experiment?

> Students overestimated the probability.

Most of us tend to overestimate the probability of a rare event when the alternative is NOT fully specified.


When one of these fifty students was asked to estimate the chance that Chicago Bulls would win the playoff, his brain instantly started operating in a confirmatory mode, selectively retrieving evidence, vivid images that are in favor of Chicago Bulls winning the playoff.

And the same thing would happen to the next student if asked to estimate the probability of Lakers winning championship.

When one was asked about any individual team's chance of winning playoff, that specific team, became the focal event, but its alternatives, any one of the other seven teams winning championship, became less defined.

Allowing a single specific scenario be under spotlight alone will trick you to overestimate the probabilities of events with uncertainty.

When it comes to decision making under uncertainty, we have to be cautious about what have been presented, and how options are presented.

Suppose you were given a chance to pick one of the two options below:
+ 21% chance to receice $100 tomorrow
+ 21% chance to receive a large blue envelope with a $100 bill in
