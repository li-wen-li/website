Today, lets talk about some psychologies associated with decision making under uncertainty.

In a video I made before, {{<youtube sMFy5HNK9Kw>}} 

I used a dice example to demonstrate the mathematical term *Expectation*, we figured the expectation in the dice problem was 3.5. There was a quite important idea in that formula: probabilitties for each outcome was 1/6, which eventually add up tp a sum of 1. Correct, this  is eventually the key idea, all probabilities add up to 1.

Let me first introduce a paper, *Belief-Based Account of Decision Under Uncertainty*, by Craig Fox, a Psychology professor from UCLA, in 1998. He disigned an experiment in which students (46 man, 4 woman) from Northwestern University, who had watched NBA in the regular season, sat down and estimated the probability that each of the eight teams in quarter final round would win the playoff.

## insert the paper figure here

Take a moment and try to find out if this figure appears any suspicious to you.

If you did pay attention, you should be able to observe that probabilities for each of the eight teams added up to 2.18, which is 218%.
Probabilitites for each division added up to 1.44, 144% and for conference, they add up to just about 1.

Now, thi s result is absolutely absurd and against what we had learned about the probability fact that probabilities for all possible events should sum up to one.

#### Well, what happened in that experiment?

> Students overestimated the probability.

Most of us tend to overestimate the probability of a rare event when the alternative is NOT fully specified.


When one of these fifty students was asked to estimate the chance that Chicago Bulls would win the playoff, his brain instantly started operating in a confirmatory mode, selectively retrieving evidence, vivid images that are in favor of Chicago Bulls winning the playoff.

And the same thing would happen to the next student if asked to estimate the probability of Lakers winning championship.

When one was asked about any individual team's chance of winning playoff, that specific team, became the focal event, but its alternatives, any one of the other seven teams winning championship, became less defined.

Allowing a single specific scenario be under spotlight alone will trick you to overestimate the probabilities of events with uncertainty.

When it comes to decision making under uncertainty, we have to be cautious about what have been presented, and how options are presented.

Suppose you were given a chance to pick one of the two options below:
+ 21% chance to receive $100 tomorrow
+ 21% chance to receive a large blue envelope with a $100 bill in

Two options given here are indeed of no monetary difference, but the second option tricks you be less sensitive to the probability (21%) by introducing a vivid representation of the outcome, that rich image generated by your brain after being offered the second option disrupts your calculation.

Now, think about the Power Ball we talked about in the video above, you could have encountered such conversation:

> "I heard a guy from Ohio won a million dollars last night."
> "What would you do if you won $1 million?"
> "I probably buy a mansion, get a private jet to travel around the world!"

Right! Our brain was occupied with all these pleasant fantasies, and left little or no room for the actual probability, and this is why you can see a long line at gas station to buy powerball tickets.

Vivid outcome is not the only cause to trick you into a wrong move when it comes to uncertainty. The way probability of rare events are presented can also fool us.

There was an experiment in which participant were to draw a red marble from one of the two urns below:
+ Urn A contains 10 marbles, 1 red marbles and 9 white marbles
+ Urn B contains 100 marbles, in which 8 are red and the rest are white

Clearly, you have 10% chance to draw a red marble if you go with urn A, and 8% you chose urn B.

The result of the experiment was quite surprising: almost 40% of participants chose  urn B and their reasoning was that. urn B had larger number of winning marbles. 

> Literally 1/10 vs 8/100

Paul Slovic from University of Oregon has given this bias a name: "denominator neglect"

It refers to the fact that people tend to pay much more attention to numerators and inadequate attention to the denominator.

Numerator often refers to the number of successful outcomes in the probability setting, paying close attention to the outcomes would somehow deliver a hopeful feeling.

__Denominator Neglect__ is unitized or manipulated in various ways.

For example. In order to gain your trust in a certain vaccine, you may have heard a pharmacy company telling you that their vaccine carries 0.001% risk of having severe side effects. They would never tell you that one in a hundred thousand would be having severe side effects after administering the vaccine. "One in a hundred thousand" tricks people to frame themselves as the the unlucky guy. Reason why they frame the probability in the format of 0.001% is that they knew about the Denominator Neglect effect.

On the other hand, lets take a look at the reported cases and deaths from Covid-19. In New Jersy, 238 individuals per 100K died from the Covid-19. And if you tranlate that into percentage form , that would be 0.00238%.

Oh no, government does not like that number, that abstract percentage number will do a decent job in relaxing people in this PANDEMIC.
